# Grandma's Recipe

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a platform for people to learn, share cooking recipes and techniques. Simultaneously, people can have a fabulous cooking experience through our platform.

A survey conducted by Hunter, a food and beverage communications firm, shows that the number of people who love cooking during the coronavirus crisis is increasing. Among approximately 1000 Americans between the ages of 18-73, 50% are learning more about cooking; 38% are discovering new ingredients; roughly one-third of them are searching for new recipes; and more than half of them said that they will continue cooking at home when the pandemic comes to the end. *(Shoup, 2020)* Another article indicates that more and more people prefer to eat at home rather than ordering meals or dining out, because it is healthier, personalized, and economical *(77% Of Americans Would Rather Eat A Homemade Meal Than Eat Out In 2019, 2020)*. Besides, there are 59% of 25-34 year-old people fond of using digital recipes while they are cooking, proved by Google Data *(Cooper, 2020)*, which further confirmed our project topic and objectives.

“Grandma’s Recipe” is an integrated recipe web application, which is suitable for a wide range of people with diverse diet habits. Specifically, cooking neophytes, such as overseas students, workers, or people who live independently, are able to make tasty meals by simply following recipe instructions; for people, like housewives, restaurant chefs, who would like to enhance their cooking competencies or eager to learn advanced dishes, this platform offers a great opportunity for them to absorb new cooking knowledge; as for elderly people who are not good at using the online application, they can adapt our website quickly as the user interfaces are designed in a friendly readable style.
